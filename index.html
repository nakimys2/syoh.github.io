I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics & Applied Probability](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu), and a faculty scientist in [Computational Research Division](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/data-science-and-technology/data-analytics-and-visualization/) at [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov)

My research interests include learning underlying relationships in large scale data. I work on topics in inference, scalable computation, and high-performance software implementation for graphical models, and I enjoy applying my research to genomic, financial, and neuroscience data.

My office is at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/92n9iTrecfB91McQ8">South Hall 5514</a>.
